## About the Collection

This collection was created for LIS9372 using GitHub CollectionBuilder. The metadata and images were provided by the course instructor. I have learned through this assignment: 

- how to use GitHub CollectionBuilder and Google sheets in a collaborative way to create a digital collection repository
- how metadata is used in digital collection building, and how to properly structure this metadata
- the importance of digital tools in digital humanities projects
- that these tools and the creation process is fun!

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
